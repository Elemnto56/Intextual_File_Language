<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Intext</h1>

## What is Intext?
Intext is a DSL based on file management and automation. Its purpose is to easily create, delete, modify, and move files efficiently and at a fast pace.

## Why use it?
I'm not one to tell you what to do, or not do, however, I can suggest that you <i>should</i> use it. Reason being, Intext has simpler syntax than Bash, and plans to be more reliable than Bash.

Along with that, most developers are power users, and need something to manage their files. While making endless Bash scripts isn't entirely a bad idea, Intext could complete the task quicker and easier.

## Where do I start?

## Who made this? 
The one and only dev, and the one currently writing this, is Elemento56 on Github. I made this with hopes that it could help others, and also as a way to cure boredom.
